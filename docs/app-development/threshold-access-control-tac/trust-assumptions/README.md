# Trust Assumptions

As the only genuinely decentralized access control service on the market, Threshold Access Control can also claim to be the most 'trustless' solution available to Web3 app buidlers – indeed, available to any developer seeking an unambiguous departure from the Web 2.0 trust paradigm.&#x20;

Nevertheless, there is no such thing as a third-party integration that imposes zero additional trust burden onto an application's end-users. Rather, when choosing infrastructural technology, it is the nature of the trust burden(s) – or the trust 'assumptions' – that really matter.&#x20;

In the case of Threshold Access Control, the trust assumptions are:&#x20;

* _non-binary_ \
  __i.e. not reducible to 'trustless' or 'trustful'.
* _non-static_\
  __i.e. they will evolve over time based on both in-protocol features and exogeneous phenomena&#x20;
* _tunable_ \
  __i.e. developers may select from a range of explicit trust assumptions on behalf of their end-users, and/or surface that optionality for their users to choose themselves.&#x20;

This section will serve to explain the implicit and explicit trust assumptions that are baked into Threshold Access Control, for the Proof-of-Concept and the Mainnet versions.

It is worth noting that too many projects in the Web3 infrastructure space seek to obscure this reality by loosely labelling their solution as 'decentralized', but fail to explain what the exact trust implications are in practice. Beware of ambiguity!
