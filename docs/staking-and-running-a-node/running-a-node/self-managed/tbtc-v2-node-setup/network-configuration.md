# Network configuration

### Required Ports

The node has to be accessible publicly to establish and maintain connections with bootstrap nodes and discovered peers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Update firewall rules as necessary, including application level firewalls.
{% endhint %}

The node exposes metrics and diagnostics services for monitoring. A network port has to be exposed publicly, so the peers can connect to your node. A Diagnostics Port has to be exposed publicly, for the rewards allocation.

| Purpose | Config Property | Protocol | Default |
| ------- | --------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Network | network.port    | TCP      | 3919    |
| Status  | clientInfo.port | TCP      | 9601    |

{% hint style="info" %}
A Diagnostics Port has to be exposed publicly, for the rewards allocation.
{% endhint %}

### **Announced Addresses**

An Announced Address is a layered addressing information (`multiaddress`/`multiaddr`) announced to the Threshold Network that is used by peers to connect with your node, e.g.: `/dns4/bootstrap-0.test.keep.network/tcp/3919` or `/ip4/104.154.61.116/tcp/3919`.

If the machine youâ€™re running your node is not exposing a public IP (e.g. it is behind NAT) you should set the `network.AnnouncedAddresses` (flag: `--network.announcedAddresses`) configuration property to an addresses (`ip4` or `dns4`) under which your node is reachable for the public.

To read more about `multiaddress` see the [libp2p docummentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/glossary/#multiaddr).
