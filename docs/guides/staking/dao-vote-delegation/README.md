# DAO Vote Delegation

To participate in DAO governance, stakers or token holders must set a governance delegate address. Vote delegation is the process of granting a delegate the power to vote on your behalf, using your voting weight, on DAO governance issues. The delegate can be yourself (self-delegation) or a third party. A configured delegate can be changed or revoked at any time.

Delegation **never involves the transfer of custody of assets** but rather just the vote weight those assets represent in the Threshold DAO.&#x20;

## Third-Party Delegation

Third-party delegates are volunteers who actively participate in Threshold governance and wish to grow their influence over critical DAO decisions. Delegates provide ETH addresses to which other Threshold token holders and Threshold stakers can delegate their vote weight. Third-party delegates are subsequently responsible for voting on Threshold governance proposals with this vote weight that others have assigned to them.

It is ideal for those who are unsure or uninterested in governance and does not want to participate in proposals, discussions, and voting. Instead, they can select active DAO members who have demonstrated a commitment to Threshold to make decisions on their behalf using their token weight and stake weight. Delegating their vote allows token holders and stakers to have an indirect say in the DAO without being involved in day-to-day governance activities.

There is no established compensation for third-party delegate contribution to governance.
